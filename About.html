<p>The Ascetic Ascent movement was founded by Kevin Tower. Kevin is in prison serving a life sentence for murder. Falling into the depths of darkness of the prison cell, Kevin found Jesus to be the one true and consistent light that would always reach him. Kevin developed a personal relationship with Jesus that set his heart on fire with Divine love filling him with Faith, Hope and Love. From his cell the Lord has steadily and increasingly guided Kevin in the Divine Life. Today, Kevin is Catholic, a Marian Catechist and a Lay Carmelite. The "Real Presence" of Jesus in the Eucharist as explained in John Chapter 6, solidified Kevin's Faith. He was not the perfect man, but knew who the perfect man was, is and always will be. There was no turning back on this road of truth that leads to the peace of Christ. While in prison Kevin was guided by many persons within the Church. Around the year 2000, a Catholic prison ministry volunteer introduced Kevin to a book called "Christian Prayer," which is the one volume version of the liturgy of the hours. Eventually he obtained a copy of the book and learned how to pray the Psalms. He currently uses the four volume version and prays it five times a day. Kevin has read a plethora books on spirituality and the writings of Saints.</p>
<p>One book Kevin took an interest in, was "The Fire Within," by the late Fr. Thomas Dubay. The Fire Within explains the spiritual doctrine of the Catholic Church and the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila and Saint John of Cross, both Carmelites. This book and his mentorship by a Religious Sister led Kevin to seek a deeper spiritual life filled with the light of Christ. This has never been easy. Prison is an environment that has become increasingly unchristian and dangerous for Christians. True Christians that follow the law and rules are not welcomed by prisoners who continue to be attached to criminal thinking and behavior. Being and authentic Catholic is a true sacrifice in most prisoners. This is much different than someone who is Catholic, but does not walk and talk the Faith.</p>
<p>Kevin trained to be a Marian Catechist and obtain his certificate to teach the Catholic Faith. It took Kevin a little over a year to complete the entire program, but it gave him skills and confidence to evangelize and prepare other men to receive the sacraments of initiation. Kevin has also thoroughly studied the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. He has had a Ignatian Retreat guided by a Priest and has also underwent a forty day Ignatian Retreat in daily life. Kevin has taught other prisoners parts of the Spiritual Exercises. In 2014 Kevin started a three year journey undergoing formation as a Lay Carmelite. Kevin was eventually received into the Lay Carmelites and later made promises to the Evangelical Counsels. </p>
<p>In the past many years Kevin has studied and started practicing authentic Spiritual Direction according to the Teachings and Spiritual Doctrine of the Catholic Church. Kevin does not believe you can leave the Church out of Spiritual Direction. In spiritual direction, the objective is to become one with Christ. </p>
<p>The Ascetic Ascent movement is about empowerment and multiplication of authentic Catholic men and women witnessing and ministering to one another. Jesus has called you and is calling you out of the darkness and into the light. Jesus leads you into the footsteps of peace! Let the Holy Spirit empower and strengthen you today! Come join us and bring your family and friends. The church is a field hospital. Our physicians (priests) and physicians assistants (deacons) need our help. We (Laity) are the nurses and paramedics that help prevent spiritual disease and the first responders to spiritual crisis. That is where the people are. They are among us and are need of our assistance. We must become the chaplains and chaplains assistants preparing the operating table of the Word for our Ordained ministers to more efficiently and effectively carry out their work. </p>
<p>Paul's letter to the Ephesians gives us the charge we must follow together as a Church. The Church is the whole Body of Christ: "And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelist, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints.</p>

<p> for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; so that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and upbuilds itself in love. 
</p>

<p>We need all hands on deck to accomplish this. The Ordained Ministers of Church are working tirelessly. They need our support. The Laity need to step up and assist the ordained by simply exercising their rights as Laity. A few hours a week of your time, will make your Priests and Deacons better and more effective. Ascetic Ascent calls the Laity to become Catechist, Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants to educate, counsel, direct and guide souls to Christ. We need to stop feeling helpless and pick up our mats and walk our Faith and become empowered to live and proclaim the Gospel! If you would like to be involved in the Ascetic Ascent movement or would like to utilize your talents to help build the movement, please contact us.
